# Economic-security
risk analyzing is important in maintaining economkc security. 
for this in simple term i:
Collect and process economic indicators (GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, trade balance, debt levels).
Use statistical models + machine learning to detect vulnerabilities.
Provide risk scores and highlight potential threats (e.g., recession risk, inflation spikes, currency instability).
Extract key topics from economic reports using NLP.

to identify these i use this feautures: 
Offer a modular design with complex functions, decorators, and clustering.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize economic indicators with pandas.
Risk Scoring: Weighted scoring system for GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, debt ratio.
Forecasting: Linear regression to predict future GDP growth.
Topic Extraction: TF-IDF + KMeans clustering for policy documents (no nltk).
Logging Decorator: Tracks function execution.
Modular Classes: Clean separation of responsibilities.
